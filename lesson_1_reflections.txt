How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?
That's because you can compare the working version with the failing one and
you can easily find what was added.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

I can see the entire process of writing code, so I can understand how code
developed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Automatic file savings could leave the file in an uncomplete state, as, for example
I had a break and did not complete a working version of the code.
Besides, browsing through code history, you can't recognize fully working 
version of the code    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
