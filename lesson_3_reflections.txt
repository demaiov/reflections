When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with a team to the same project or, if I want to develop the project from
different laptops or PCs.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy on GitHub site of a repository
A clone is a copy from GitHub repository to local
A branch is a new commit of the code different from master
If I want to develop my own version, I would fork a repository
If I want to have a local copy, I would clone
If I want to collaborate writing code, I would branch
