What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates an empty .git directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a pre-commit area, so it is an area between working directory and the repository.
You put in staging area what you will commit later, plus you can remove from staging area what you don't want to commit.
