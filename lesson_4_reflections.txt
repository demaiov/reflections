What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Just to work and contribute while offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Sending around files and probably messing up. Github will help to avoid that.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
You can try the changes without affecting main version of the projects.
